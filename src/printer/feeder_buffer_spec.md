# feeder_buffer.py — Design Specification

## Overview

A standalone Klipper extra that adapts the Belay single-sensor sync logic for a two-sensor buffer design. Intended as a drop-in replacement for Belay + BTT Smart Filament Sensor jam detection, with a clean migration path to AFC if the user later adopts it.

---

## Goals

- Replace Belay (secondary extruder sync) per tool
- Replace BTT Smart Filament Sensor jam detection per tool
- No AFC dependency
- Clean, complete removal path if migrating to AFC
- AFC config parameter names used throughout for migration compatibility
- Support arbitrary number of named instances (N tools, no hardcoded limit)

---

## Non-Goals

- Runout detection (handled externally — toolhead sensor or rewinder switch)
- Any modification to load/unload macros
- Multi-file architecture — single `.py` file only
- Any external dependencies beyond standard Klipper internals

---

## Hardware Context

- Printer: Bobby (5 tools), Ricky (6 tools, future)
- Secondary extruders are `extruder_stepper` objects (e.g. `_tool0_feeder`), not named extruders
- All feeder steppers on a shared `feeder` MCU
- The dual-sensor mode has two sensors: `advance` (buffer expanded) and `trailing` (buffer compressed)

---

## File Structure

```
klippy/extras/feeder_buffer.py   # single file, drop into extras/
```

No installer, no other files required.

---

## Config Section

Section name: `[feeder_buffer <name>]`

Each instance picks its sensor topology via `sensor_mode` (optional, default
`dual`). This lets one printer.cfg mix two-sensor tools and
Belay-compatible single-sensor tools under the same module, on the same
branch.

### `sensor_mode: dual` (default) — two-sensor buffer

```ini
[feeder_buffer T0]
sensor_mode: dual               # optional — this is the default
advance_pin: ^PA1               # required — AFC name match
trailing_pin: ^PA2              # required — AFC name match
extruder_stepper: _tool0_feeder # required — not in AFC (AFC manages this itself)
multiplier_high: 1.05           # optional, default 1.05 — AFC name + default match
multiplier_low: 0.95            # optional, default 0.95 — AFC name + default match
filament_error_sensitivity: 5   # optional, default 0 (disabled) — AFC name match
                                # 0 = disabled, 1 = least sensitive, 10 = most sensitive
                                # formula: fault_distance = (11 - sensitivity) * 10 mm
debug_console: True            # optional, default True — prints state transitions to
                                # the console (see "Debug Console Output" below)
```

### `sensor_mode: single` — Belay-compatible single-sensor buffer

Sensor-compatible with the Annex-Engineering Belay hardware design (see
CREDITS.md) — one switch, no neutral dead zone, **no jam detection**
(a single switch can't tell "stuck expanded" from "stuck compressed", and
Belay itself doesn't attempt jam detection either). `filament_error_sensitivity`
is not a valid option in this mode — Klipper's config validation will error at
startup if it's left in a single-mode section by mistake.

```ini
[feeder_buffer T5]
sensor_mode: single             # required — selects the single-sensor class
sensor_pin: ^PC3                # required
invert_sensor: False            # optional, default False — flip active-state
                                 # if wiring/logic reads backwards
extruder_stepper: _tool5_feeder # required
multiplier_high: 1.05           # optional, default 1.05 — matches Belay's default
multiplier_low: 0.95            # optional, default 0.95 — matches Belay's default
debug_console: True             # optional, default True — see "Debug Console Output" below
```

## Sensor Logic / State Machine

Three states per instance:

| State      | Condition                        | Action                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `advancing`| trailing pin triggered           | apply `multiplier_low` to rotation_distance  |
| `trailing` | advance pin triggered            | apply `multiplier_high` to rotation_distance |
| `neutral`  | neither pin triggered            | no rotation_distance change                 |

- `multiplier_high` increases rotation_distance → slows secondary extruder → buffer compresses
- `multiplier_low` decreases rotation_distance → speeds secondary extruder → buffer expands
- Neutral zone provides hysteresis — no hunting

State mirrors AFC `AFC_buffer` logic exactly so behaviour is consistent pre/post migration.

---

## Debug Console Output

`debug_console` (default `True`, per-instance) makes every state transition
print to the console via `gcode.respond_info`, e.g.:

```
Buffer T0: neutral -> advancing
Buffer T0: advancing -> neutral
```

Only fires on an actual state change (not on every sensor poll), so it's
useful for confirming the sensors are wired correctly and triggering as
filament moves, without flooding the console. Set to `False` per-tool once
you've verified a buffer is working, to keep the console quiet during real
prints.

---

## Jam Detection

Uses `filament_error_sensitivity` to derive a `fault_distance` in mm:

```
fault_distance = (11 - sensitivity) * 10
```

- Monitors extruder position
- If extruder travels `fault_distance` mm without a buffer state change, jam is triggered
- Sensitivity 0 disables fault detection entirely
- On trigger: calls `FEEDER_BUFFER_JAM` macro with `TOOL=<name>` and `SENSOR=<advance|trailing>`
  - `advance` stuck triggered → buffer expanding but not compressing → downstream clog
  - `trailing` stuck triggered → buffer compressing but not expanding → upstream feed problem

---

## Jam Macro

A default macro ships with the module as a GCode macro in the `.py` file:

```ini
[gcode_macro FEEDER_BUFFER_JAM]
description: Called when a jam is detected by feeder_buffer. Override to customise behaviour.
gcode:
    {action_respond_info("Jam detected on %s (sensor: %s)" % (params.TOOL, params.SENSOR))}
    PAUSE
```

User can override by redefining `[gcode_macro FEEDER_BUFFER_JAM]` in their own config. The module always calls the macro by name, so the override takes effect transparently.

---

## GCode Commands

Mirror AFC buffer commands exactly:

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `QUERY_BUFFER` | `BUFFER=<name>` | Reports current state and rotation_distance of named instance |
| `SET_ROTATION_FACTOR` | `BUFFER=<name> FACTOR=<float>` | Directly applies a rotation factor to the extruder_stepper |
| `SET_BUFFER_MULTIPLIER` | `BUFFER=<name> MULTIPLIER=<HIGH\|LOW> FACTOR=<float>` | Live-adjusts multiplier_high or multiplier_low |

---

## Belay Migration Notes

For a tool currently running the actual Belay module, switching to
`feeder_buffer.py` with `sensor_mode: single` means:

- Same physical sensor, same wiring — just point `sensor_pin` at whatever
  pin the Belay config used for its switch.
- `multiplier_high`/`multiplier_low` carry across unchanged (same names,
  same defaults).
- Jam detection is not gained or lost — Belay never had it.
- Remove the `[belay]` (or equivalent) section and the Belay module install;
  add `[feeder_buffer <name>]` with `sensor_mode: single` instead.

This lets every tool across every printer install from the same
`feeder_buffer.py` file/branch, regardless of which sensor hardware
that tool has.

---

## Removal / AFC Migration Instructions

**To remove the module:**
1. Delete `feeder_buffer.py` from `klippy/extras/`
2. Remove all `[feeder_buffer <name>]` sections from config
3. Remove `[gcode_macro FEEDER_BUFFER_JAM]` if defined
4. Restart Klipper

Nothing else is modified by this module — no side effects to clean up.

**To migrate to AFC:**
1. Install AFC per its documentation
2. For each `[feeder_buffer <name>]` section:
   - Change section header to `[AFC_buffer <name>]`
   - Remove the `extruder_stepper` line (AFC manages stepper assignment itself)
   - All other parameters (`advance_pin`, `trailing_pin`, `multiplier_high`, `multiplier_low`, `filament_error_sensitivity`) copy across unchanged
3. Remove `feeder_buffer.py` and `[gcode_macro FEEDER_BUFFER_JAM]`
4. Follow AFC documentation for buffer assignment to lanes/steppers

## Key Implementation Notes for Coding

- Use `printer.lookup_object('extruder_stepper <name>')` to get stepper reference
- Modify `rotation_distance` via the stepper's `stepper` attribute at runtime
- Register buttons via `printer.lookup_object('buttons')` using `register_button`
- Jam detection timer via `reactor.register_timer`
- Each instance is fully independent — separate class, separate state, separate timer
- `load_config_prefix` used to support named instances
- Default macro registered via `printer.load_config` pattern or included as a separate `[gcode_macro]` block in a bundled `.cfg` file — TBD based on cleanest Klipper pattern
